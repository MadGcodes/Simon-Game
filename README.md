# Simon Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Simon Game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **jQuery**. The game involves four colored squares, and the player must replicate a randomly generated pattern by clicking on the correct sequence of colors. The levels increase as the game progresses, and the game restarts if the player clicks the wrong square.
